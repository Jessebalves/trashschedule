Hopefully be able to make a webpage for garbage collection schedules.

This repo is made to just have the source files neccessary for compilation, you are required to drop the files into an IDE of your choice. 
The simplest way to use this repo is to pull these to a seperate folder outside your IDE and drag-drop the files to your desired location, edit them, then drag-drop them to a 'staging' area for pushing/pulling.

(eclipse has so much bs in the project files, so I decided to go this route)

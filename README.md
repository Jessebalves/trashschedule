# trashschedule
Hopefully be able to make a webpage for garbage collection schedules.

This repo is made to just have the source files neccessary for compilation, you are required to drop the files into an IDE of your choice. 
The simplest way to use this repo is to pull these to a seperate folder outside your IDE and drag-drop the files to your desired location, edit them, then drag-drop them to a 'staging' area for pushing/pulling.

(eclipse has so much bs in the project files, so I decided to go this route)

TODO:
  1) Make a way to convert street, drive, and boulevard to their abreviated names to match it up with CSV
  2) Implement holiday skips since trash pickup is cancelled on select holidays
  3) transfer entire project to web so you wont have to use CLI or IDE to use program.

# trashschedule
Hopefully be able to make a webpage for garbage collection schedules for the greater Union County.

TODO:
  1) ~~Make a way to convert street, drive, and boulevard to their abreviated names to match it up with CSV~~
  2) ~~Implement holiday skips since trash pickup is cancelled on select holidays~~
  3) transfer entire project to html so you wont have to use CLI or IDE to use program.
  4) ~~better way to pull/push from ide??~~
